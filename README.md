# [IJCV-2024] ViDSOD-100: A New Dataset and a Baseline Model for RGB-D Video Salient Object Detection
This repository is the official implementation of [ViDSOD-100](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-024-02051-5#Abs1)


## TODO List
- [x]  ~~release dataset~~
- [] release code
- [] release weights


## Data
You can download our ViDSOD-100 dataset from [here]([https://github.com/shadow2496/VITON-HD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UDPHdgygVJxuAigJuBy8aTPRt8A6Our9/view?usp=sharing)).<br>
For both training and inference, the following dataset structure is required:

```
vidsod_100
|-- train
|-- train_flow
|-- test
|-- test_flow
```
